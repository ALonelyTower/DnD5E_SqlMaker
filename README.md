Wanted to create a database of Dungeons & Dragons 5e Spells for easier offline viewing.  After attempting to insert a
couple spells into the database, it became apparent that the process would be both tedious, and error-prone.  As such,
wanted to take the opportunity to take some of what I learned from BudgetApp and apply it here:  By creating a GUI for
quickly appending Sql Insert Statements to a file.
